Calculate SCCs...
- Number of SCCs: 10
- The problem is acyclic
Selected Planning Algorithm: progression search
Parsing heuristics ...
Number of specified heuristics: 1
- Calculating minimal implied costs and distances (0 ms)
Heuristic #0 = hhRC2(lmc;distance;correct count)
Search config:
 - type: path cost
 - weight: 1
 - suboptimal: false
Visited List configured
- mode: total order
- hashs to use: state task task-sequence
- memory information: topological ordering
- Visited list allows deletion of search nodes: true
Search Configuration
- Using JAIR 2020 progression algorithm
- Search is stopped after first solution is found.
- Utilizing heuristics.
- A* Search
- Distance G is "modification depth"
