Selected Planning Algorithm: progression searchParsing heuristics ...
Number of specified heuristics: 0
No heuristics given, setting default ... 
- the option "store cuts" of the RC heuristic can only be used with the inner heuristic LM-Cut. It will be disabled.
- Calculating minimal implied costs and distances (0 ms)
Heuristic #0 = hhRC2(ff;distance;correct count)
