Search config:
 - type: cost optimal
 - weight: 2
 - suboptimal: false
Visited List configured
- mode: partial order
- hashs to use: state task task-sequence

Search Configuration
- Using JAIR 2020 progression algorithm
- Search is stopped after first solution is found.
- Greedy A* Search with weight 2
- Distance G is "modification depth"
