Selected Planning Algorithm: progression searchParsing heuristics ...
Number of specified heuristics: 1
- the option "store cuts" of the RC heuristic can only be used with the inner heuristic LM-Cut. It will be disabled.
- Calculating minimal implied costs and distances (0 ms)
Heuristic #0 = hhRC2(add;distance;correct count)
Search config:
 - type: cost optimal
 - weight: 2
 - suboptimal: false
Visited List configured
- mode: parallel sequences order
- hashs to use: state task task-sequence

Search Configuration
- Using JAIR 2020 progression algorithm
- Search is stopped after first solution is found.
- Greedy A* Search with weight 2
- Distance G is "modification depth"
