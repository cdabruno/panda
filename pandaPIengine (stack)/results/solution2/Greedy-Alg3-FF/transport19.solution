Number of specified heuristics: 0
No heuristics given, setting default ... 
- the option "store cuts" of the RC heuristic can only be used with the inner heuristic LM-Cut. It will be disabled.

Search Configuration
- Using JAIR 2020 progression algorithm
- Search is stopped after first solution is found.
